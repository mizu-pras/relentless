# Relentless

Autonomous multi-agent orchestration plugin for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), now a fully self-contained orchestration system.

**Type `/unleash "build X"` and don't touch your keyboard until it's done.**

Relentless breaks complex tasks into specialized work, dispatches them to purpose-built agents, and loops until everything is 100% complete — tests passing, code reviewed, build green.

## What It Does

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Autonomous deep work | `/unleash` plans, dispatches agents, and drives to completion |
| Multi-model orchestration | 5 specialized agents, each on the optimal model |
| Completion loop | `/pursuit` repeats until all criteria are met |
| Codebase mapping | `/recon` generates and audits `AGENTS.md` files |
| Session resilience | `/resume` picks up interrupted work from saved state |
| Runaway protection | 5-layer circuit breaker prevents infinite loops |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (creates symlinks, copies default config)
bash ~/.config/opencode/relentless/install.sh

# Restart OpenCode, then:
/unleash "Build a REST API with user authentication"
```

To uninstall:

```bash
bash ~/.config/opencode/relentless/uninstall.sh
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/unleash "task"` | Full autonomous orchestration — plan, dispatch, pursue, validate |
| `/pursuit` | Completion loop until all todos are 100% done |
| `/recon` | Scan codebase and generate/audit `AGENTS.md` files |
| `/resume` | Resume an interrupted session from saved state |
| `/status` | Show current orchestration state and progress |
| `/halt` | Stop all orchestration immediately, save state |
| `/halt clear` | Clear the halt flag so `/resume` can proceed |

## Agents

Five specialized agents, each assigned to the model best suited for its role:

| Agent | Model | Role | Category |
|-------|-------|------|----------|
| **Conductor** | Claude Opus | Orchestrator — plans, delegates, validates. Never writes code. | `orchestrate` |
| **Artisan** | GPT-5.3 Codex | Deep coder — features, tests, refactoring. Goal-oriented. | `deep` |
| **Maestro** | GPT-5.3 Codex | UI/UX specialist — bold aesthetics, anti-generic design. | `visual` |
| **Sentinel** | Claude Sonnet | Quality guardian — debugging, code review, architecture. | `reason` |
| **Scout** | GLM-5 | Fast explorer — read-only reconnaissance and file search. | `quick` |

**Authority hierarchy:** Conductor > Sentinel > Artisan/Maestro > Scout

### Runtime State

During orchestration, state lives in `.relentless/` (project-local):

- `current-pursuit.json` — Active plan, progress, agent assignments
- `halt` — Created by `/halt`, checked by all agents before every action

## How `/unleash` Works

```
1. IntentGate        → Classify intent, detect ambiguity
2. Conductor plans   → Brainstorm if complex, create structured plan
3. Scout recon       → Understand codebase structure and patterns
4. File ownership    → Pre-assign files per agent (no conflicts)
5. Parallel dispatch → Artisan, Maestro, Sentinel work concurrently
6. Pursuit loop      → Repeat until 100% (max 10 iterations)
7. Final validation  → Tests pass, build green, Sentinel sign-off
8. Report            → Summary of what was built
```

**Trivial tasks** (single file, < 20 lines) skip full orchestration and are handled directly.

## Circuit Breaker

Five independent layers prevent runaway loops:

| Layer | Protection | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1. Error classification | Identifies token limit, rate limit, network errors | Token limits **never** retried |
| 2. Consecutive failures | Tracks failure streaks per session | 3 consecutive failures → STOP |
| 3. Injection rate limiter | Max 3 injections per 60-second window | Prevents flooding |
| 4. Token budget | Monitors context window usage | Stops at 85% capacity |
| 5. Dead session detection | Detects stalled sessions | Reports to user with recovery options |

## Configuration

Configuration uses JSONC (comments and trailing commas allowed).

**Merge priority:** project > user > defaults

| File | Scope |
|------|-------|
| `defaults.jsonc` | Built-in defaults (shipped with plugin) |
| `~/.config/opencode/relentless.jsonc` | User-level overrides |
| `.opencode/relentless.jsonc` | Project-level overrides |

### Configurable Settings

```jsonc
{
  // Category-to-agent routing
  "categories": {
    "deep": "artisan",
    "visual": "maestro",
    "quick": "scout",
    "reason": "sentinel",
    "orchestrate": "conductor"
  },

  // Circuit breaker thresholds
  "circuit_breaker": {
    "max_consecutive_failures": 3,
    "max_injections_per_minute": 3,
    "token_budget_threshold": 0.85
  },

  // Pursuit (completion loop) settings
  "pursuit": {
    "max_iterations": 10,
    "require_progress": true,
    "stall_limit": 2
  }
}
```

## Skills

Relentless is self-contained and ships with both core orchestration skills and built-in workflow skills:

| Category | Skills |
|----------|--------|
| Core orchestration | intent-gate, todo-enforcer, using-relentless, pursuit, unleash, recon, ui-craft |
| Workflow | brainstorming, writing-plans, test-driven-development, systematic-debugging, verification-before-completion, requesting-code-review, receiving-code-review, finishing-a-development-branch, using-git-worktrees, writing-skills |

During autonomous `/unleash` runs, Conductor acts as **proxy user** for skill approval checkpoints — no human intervention needed between task start and final report.
